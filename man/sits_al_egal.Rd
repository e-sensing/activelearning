\usage{
sits_al_egal(
  samples_tb,
  data_cube,
  sim_method = "correlation",
  alpha = NULL,
  beta = alpha,
  w = 0.5,
  n_samples = 1000,
  multicores = 2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{samples_tb}{A sits tibble.}

\item{data_cube}{A sits data cube.}

\item{sim_method}{A character. A method for computing the similarity
among samples as described in the function dist in the
package proxy.}

\item{alpha}{A double. It controls the radius of the neighborhood
used in the estimation of sample density.}

\item{beta}{A double. It controls the radius of the neighborhood
used in the estimation of the sample candidate set. A
bigger beta gives a bigger set. By default is set to
be equal to alpha. If NULL, it is computed internally.}

\item{w}{A numeric (between 0 and 1) only used when beta is
NULL. This proportion parameter balances the influence
of diversity and density in the selection strategy.
When w is 0, EGAL becomes a pure-diversity
and when w is 1, EGAL becomes a pure density-based
sampling algorithm.}

\item{n_samples}{The number of random points to take.}

\item{multicores}{The number of cores available for active learning.}
}
\value{
\preformatted{           A sits tibble with the EGAL metric. This metric
                   ranks samples based on their density and diversity.
                   Those samples with highest EGAL should be selected
                   first for labeling.

\description{
Active Learning improves the results of a classification by
feeding the classifier with informative samples. This function returns a sits
tibble of new samples selected at random along with their score in the metric
Exploration Guided Active Learning (EGAL).
